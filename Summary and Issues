Modifications:
(1) Vairables which would be used to the train the model have been screened further, and the ones came after HAT were deleted.
(2) Youdex index has been used in PSM model to find out the best cut-off value of classification.
(3) Some modifications were made to induce model convergence.

Issues:
(1) Still trying to find a better method for selecting variables, in particular categorical ones. A few progress was made but not enough, so the relavent codes have not been showed.
